# Code-Quiz

This is a web based quiz, which allows the user to test their knowledge in the coding language. The timed quiz allows the user to select an answer, and then notifies the user if the answer is correct or false. At the end of the quiz the users score will be recorded in the highscores section, if they finished with a high enough score, within the given time interval. 

# Description

Build a coding language based quiz from scratch using the skills we have learned from the previous weeks. To complete this assignment I will use my knowledge in HTML to create an html.index file which is linked to a CSS file, as well as a javascript file. I will use my understanding of CSS to make the quiz appealing to the eye as well as my javascript knowledge to make the program run and function the way that i want it to. The user will be given a set amount of time to complete the 5 questions provided on the quiz, and then asked to record their name once they have finished to be saved on the highscores for the quiz.
